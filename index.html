<h1>What is CRYPTO-CURRENCY?</h1>
<p><a src="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.</a></p>

			<td>An open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.

			At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto movement that makes people smile! It is also an opensource peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises blockchain technology, a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called nodes. </td>

			<td><a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/is-dogecoin-a-good-investment/#:~:text=Is%20Dogecoin%20a%20good%20investment%20long%2Dterm%3F,is%20recommended%20to%20mitigate%20risks.">Dogecoin was created in 2013, inspired by the popular Shiba Inu meme. Initially, it went unnoticed by investors. In 2018, investors looking for cheap altcoins flocked to Dogecoin. Its market capitalization quickly doubled, reaching over a billion dollars.

			In 2021, Elon Musk’s tweets catapulted Dogecoin to fame. Each tweet boosted the cryptocurrency’s value, leading to a new all-time high market cap of around $70 billion in May 2021.

			However, Dogecoin’s market cap fell by the end of May 2021. Despite this, Musk’s continued support helped it recover throughout 2022, though it didn’t reach a new ATH. </a></td>

			<td>Stellar is a decentralized, public blockchain that gives developers the tools to create experiences that are more like cash than crypto. The network is faster, cheaper, and far more energy-efficient than most blockchain-based systems. It’s designed so Stellar’s ecosystem can make a real-world, lasting impact.</td>

The native Lumens token (XLM) facilitates transactions by acting as an intermediary for exchanging currencies and reducing fees. The Stellar project is actively fostering partnerships with various financial institutions, including those focused on remittances and banking services, thus reinforcing its market position.

			According to experts, the short-term outlook for Stellar Lumens is shrouded in ambiguity. However, when it comes to long-term investments, many analysts remain optimistic. By 2030, they predict a growth of over 400% from current values. While short-term volatility carries inherent risks, the cryptocurrency's expanding scope and increasing number of partner projects could lead to significant long-term growth.</td></a>

			<td>Ripple is a digital payment network and protocol launched in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. The network uses XRP as its native cryptocurrency to enable fast, low-cost international money transfers and currency exchanges.</td>

			<td>Ripple was first founded back in 2004 as RipplePay in Vancouver, Canada by Ryan Fugger as a way of securely moving money around the world. In 2012, Fugger sold the company to Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, who transformed the company into a digital currency network and renamed it OpenCoin. McCaleb, who was the former founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange, Mt. Gox, left the company and forked Ripple into Stellar in 2013.</td>
